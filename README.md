The Java programmer's life is a text-based game that demonstrates the use of file handing, multiple classes, and the pillars of object oriented programming

This program uses several grammar files found in the files folder to randomly generate sentences representing in game challenges. The player's success or failure is a mathematical formula that weighs character strengths against the challenge type. A small margin is thrown into this calculation for luck. This ensures the game's output is never predictable or repeatable. Each pass of the game will be different.
